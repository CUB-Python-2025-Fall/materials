## BorrowBox — MVP

**Goal:** Enable neighbors to **list tools** and let others **find them easily**.

### Features

1. **Tool Listing**

   * Owners can create a tool entry with a name, short description, photo, and contact info (phone/email).

2. **Tool Search/Browse**

   * Borrowers can browse and search available tools to discover what’s nearby.

**Flow:**
Owner lists a tool → Tool appears in search → Borrower finds it → Borrower contacts owner directly (outside the app).

## Follow-Up: Next Feature

**Availability Calendar**

* **As a borrower**, I want to see when a tool is available so I don’t waste time requesting something that’s already in use.
* **As an owner**, I want to mark when my tool is lent out so I avoid overlapping requests.
