## Typing in Python

Your task is to understand the typing in Python. \
Recommended tutorial: [Typing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking) \
Note: Chapter `Typing Theory` is **optional**

Few important things:

- You can consider `pyrefly` as a faster version of `mypy`
- The tutorial is slightly outdated
    - For example, instead of `Union[str, int]` and `Optional[int]` you use `str | int` and `int | None`
